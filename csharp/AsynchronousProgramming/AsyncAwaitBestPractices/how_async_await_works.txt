The “async” keyword enables the “await” keyword in that method and changes how method results are
handled. That’s all the async keyword does! There are no background threads involved.

An async method
  1. Runs normally (synchronously) until "await" is hit.
  2. await checks its awaitable. If it has completed then the method continues running normally.
     If it has not completed, it tells the awaitable to run the remainder of the method when it
     completes, and then returns from the async method.
  3. Later on, when the awaitable completes, it will execute the remainder of the async method
